# MSWS - Isaac
Hello! This is my GitHub. Allow me to show off a few of my projects.

- **[Nodifts](https://nodifts.msws.xyz/)** is an LED-like representation of arbitrary data that allows me to know my current stats at a glance. It works great as a wallpaper, is easily expandable, and is still in development! Built with bun, TypeScript, and Express.
- **[Jailbreak](https://github.com/edgegamers/jailbreak)** is a Counter-Strike 2 gamemode plugin that I've worked alongside with [EdgeGamers](https://edgm.rs/) to develop. It's a fun and unique game mode that has been around for over a decade!
- **[Tetris](https://github.com/MSWS/Tetris)** is a python recreation of the classic game!

You can reach me through email at [contact@msws.xyz](mailto:contact@msws.xyz) or Discord (MSWS).

## What I'm Doing
I'm currently working towards a CS Bachelors Degree. In the meantime, I'm exercising my brain with [eGO](https://edgm.rs/), an online gaming community. You can see a full list of my projects [here](https://github.com/MSWS?tab=repositories). Happy browsing!
