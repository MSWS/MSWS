# MSWS - Isaac
Hello! This is my GitHub. Allow me to show off a few of my projects.

- **[JavaStats](https://github.com/MSWS/JavaStats)** is a Spring-boot Java application to scrape [GameTracker]([url](https://www.gametracker.com/server_info/jb.csgo.edgegamers.cc:27015/)) statistics of a server and formats them for copy-pasting.
- **[bhop-reports](https://github.com/MSWS/bhop-reports)** is a SourceMod reporting system meant for Shavit's BHop timer. It supports creating, handling, and deleting reports.
- **[Tetris](https://github.com/MSWS/Tetris)** is a python recreation of the classic game!

## What I'm Doing
I'm currently working towards a CS Bachelors Degree. In the meantime, I'm exercising my brain with [GFL](https://gflclan.com/), an online gaming community. You can see a full list of my projects [here](https://github.com/MSWS?tab=repositories). Happy browsing!
